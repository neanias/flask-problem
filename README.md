Python/Flask Exercise
----------------------

You have been engaged by a 'top secret competitor' of MarktoMarket to create a prototype Rest API in Python using the Flask microframework. The client wants the API to support a React frontend. The API should support the following:-

  * The ability to list and browse all the companies in their database.
  * For a given company to see the transactions that they have been involved in.
  * The ability to create a valuation project, and a way to add and remove transactions from a project.
  * The ability to view all the transactions in a given project
  * The ability to view all valuation projects for a given user.

The prototype needs to be ready for the front end developer in about three hours time; the CEO has supplied some sample transaction data for use in the prorotype.

*What we're looking for*
  * Demonstrate that you understand how to build a Rest API


*What we don't care about?*
  * Don't worry about any sort of data store.
  * Don't worry about security.
